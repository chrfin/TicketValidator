70XXCLEANBOOTANDBLANK.ZIP

This file is intended for use when both a blank Application Folder and a CLEAN BOOT of an MC70XX WM 5.0 device is required.  Unzip the contents of this device to either the root of an SD Card (and place the SD Card in your device) OR the TEMP folder.  Then follow the UPDATE LOADER boot instructions below.


There are two methods to perform an Update Loader Boot on MC70XX:

Method 1
1. Navigate to the location where the ZIP file was unzipped
2. Tap 'StartUpdLdr.exe'
3. After 20 seconds or so, the device will perform an Update Loader boot which will cause the PKGS.LST file deposited on the device to be processed. Leave the device on A/C power during the Update Loader process


Method 2
1. Cold boot the MC70XX by pressing the 1 Key + 9 Key + Power Key simultaneously.
2. Immediately as soon as the device starts to boot (before the splash screen is visible), hold the upper right hand trigger key.
3. The screen should display a message with the words "Update Warning" at the top of the screen.
3. Place the device on A/C power either by placing it in a cradle or a CAM.  The update will automatically start after AC power is detected.
6. The device will invoke an Update Loader boot, which will cause the PKGS.LST file deposited on the device to be processed. Leave the device on A/C power during the Update Loader process.  

When the device has completed the process it will return to the Windows Mobile ""Tap the screen to set up your Windows Mobile-based device" screen.  At this point, if you used an SD card, please remove it from the device.  If you placed the files in the TEMP folder, they will be automatically erased by the CLEAN BOOT process.
